### How to run test cases
If the executable is not already present, run `make` to compile and build the executable, then run `./TestBlackjack` to run our script. In this repository we have also added a shell script `./TestBlackjack.sh` which will perform the same actions as above. (Note: you may need to enable persmissions for the shell script by running `chmod +x ./TestBlackjack.sh`)
